# Esp Generic Board
The goal of this project is to build a PCB that exposes some of the generic output of a ESP32 DevKit on a PCB of 8 * 8cm

## Inputs
### Power Supply
You can power the board from :
- A AC-DC converter with format HLK-PMxx, like this one : https://amzn.to/3MS7B2v
  - You have to put the jumper Jin on 3.3V or 5V depending of the power supply
  - I suggest to power with 5V to ensure max output
